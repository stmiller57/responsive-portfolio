# Personal portfolio
## Project description
The original project called for the creation of a professional portfolio with three related pages — about, portfolio and contact. 

The project has undergone significant revisions since my original homework. Rather than spread my work across three pages, I switched to a single-page format. The headings in the navbar take you to the three main sections of my portfolio site — About, Coding Portfolio and Recent Writing. As someone who codes and writes, I wanted to incorporate both creative pieces of my work life into one site. 

I opted for a green, gray, white and black color scheme for my site. I've also switched to one of Google's fonts, Lato, throughout the project. 

## Technologies used
1. HTML5
2. Bootstrap
3. Custom CSS

## Future development
My next planned steps include the design and implementation of a logo into my navbar. I also plan to continue tweaking the design in the weeks ahead. I would like to find a way to add the computer languages I have learned in an interesting way.
