# responsive-portfolio
## Project description
This project called for the creation of a professional portfolio with three related pages â€” about, portfolio and contact. 

I started with the "about" page by using Boostrap to create a navbar and a bio card with my photo and some information about me. I later added a footer. 

To further spruce up my "about" page, I added a three-card column with links to recent stories I've written for publication. 

I moved onto the "portfolio" page next, copying the navbar and footer from my "about" page and updating the navbar links with matching text. I used the Bootstrap grid system to do three cards in the top row and two cards in the second row, adding dummy text and photos that will be replaced as I begin to complete projects. 

The final page is a contact form. I again copied the navbar and footer to add it to the page, giving my site a consistent look and links that work. I then used Boostrap to find a basic form content area and adjusted the text to fit my needs.
